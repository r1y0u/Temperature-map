# Temperature-map
Creating a crude temperature map. A TemperatureMap class indicates areas of different temperature by the use of different colors. Our map will represent a square area. The temperatures are contained in a 2d int array. Each element in the array represents the temperature in a square area 20 miles on a side. We assume the temperature is the same through-out the area.
